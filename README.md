# Ctrl-GenAug
This codebase provides the official PyTorch implementation for Ctrl-GenAug: Controllable Generative Augmentation for Medical Sequence Classification (Under Review)

[![Ctrl-GenAug-previous-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Previous%20Version-arXiv-b31b1b?logo=arxiv&logoColor=red)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17091)

## 📖 Introduction
In this work, we present *Ctrl-GenAug*, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid **medical sequence classification**. Specifically, we first design a **multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator** for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a **noisy synthetic data filter** to suppress unreliable cases at the semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 5 medical datasets with 4 different modalities, including comparisons with 15 augmentation methods and evaluations using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of *Ctrl-GenAug*, particularly with pronounced performance gains in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Requirements:
- Python==3.8.13
- torch==1.12.1+cu116
- torchvision==0.13.1+cu116
- transformers==4.34.1
- tokenizers==0.14.1
- ffmpeg
- motion-vector-extractor==1.0.6

You can also create an identical environment to ours using the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

### 2. Download the Public Real Datasets

- [MosMedData](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/mosmeddata-chest-ct-scans-with-covid19)
- [MRNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/)
- [ACDC](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/)
- [TUSC](https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/datasets/a72f2b02-7b53-4c5d-963c-d7253220bfd5)

### 3. Pre-process the Real Datasets

We provide the preprocessing scripts and data split information. Please follow the steps below.

#### Step (a) Extract all slices/frames and save their metadata, including file names and labels:

```bash
# For MosMedData
python MosMedData/extract_all_slices.py
```

#### Step (b) Perform uniform sampling based on the data extracted in step (a)

```bash
# For MosMedData
python MosMedData/sample_sequences.py \
    --all_slices_dir <> \
    --mode <> \
    --frames_per_clip 15 \
    --clip_sampling_interval 1 \
    --required_clip_num 8
```

```
--all_slices_dir                              # Output directory containing all slices extracted in step (a)
--mode                                        # Train and test only
--frames_per_clip  --clip_sampling_interval   # Please refer to the script for the parameter descriptions
```

## Diagnosis-promotive Synthetic Datasets

To support research in medical sequence analysis, we released the synthetic databases generated by *Ctrl-GenAug*. We hope these resources could serve as a valuable supplement for model development.
